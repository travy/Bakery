##  Rationale

Android Application developed for Udacity Course

##  Description

Android application which utilizes a set of libraries to construct a modern robust
application capable of parsing data from a RESTful service and displaying meaningful
results

##  Configurations

None known at this time.

##  Tested VM's

The applicaton has been tested on Android x86 emulators utilizing Android Marshmellow
and Nougat.

##  Contribution

This application is being developed for a Nano-Degree program which I am currently
enrolled in for Udacity. Because of this I am not looking for assistance at this
time. Thank you for your interest in the project, perhaps in the future once I am
finished with the program we can refine the app for an open-source project.

##  Target SDK

Since the requirements for the app did not specify a target SDK, I've decided to
target Android Api 23 (Lollipop) and up as the minimum supported version.

This choice was made after reviewing the Android Dashboard which shows that most
users are running newer versions of Android and reading about several articles
explaining of the various security issues with Android Kitkat and lower.
